This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app. The build process fails with the error "Could not find module `@react-native-community/async-storage'" even though the package is correctly installed in the project's dependencies.  This typically arises when the native modules are not correctly linked during the build process. The error message is misleading as the module's actual issue is linked to the native side and not a simple import issue.
