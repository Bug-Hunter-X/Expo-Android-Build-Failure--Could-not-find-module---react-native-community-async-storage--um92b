This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while building an Android app using Expo CLI. The build process fails with an error indicating that the `@react-native-community/async-storage` module cannot be found despite its presence in the project's dependencies. This issue is resolved by properly configuring the native modules for Android during the build process.  The solution involves using the correct Expo build commands and ensuring the native dependencies are properly handled.
