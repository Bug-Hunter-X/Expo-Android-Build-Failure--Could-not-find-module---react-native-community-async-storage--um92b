The solution involves running the expo prebuild command to ensure the native modules are correctly linked before building. Here's how you can fix this:

1. **Install the required packages:**
```bash
expo install @react-native-community/async-storage
```
2. **Run Expo prebuild:**
```bash
expo prebuild
```
3. **Build the Android app:**
```bash
expo build:android
```
The `expo prebuild` command prepares the project for building by correctly linking all the native dependencies required for the application including the AsyncStorage module.  If this does not solve the issue, ensure you have correctly configured your android environment and have the required android build tools installed.
